# python_lab_3

Lab3 is similar to Lab2 but allows for time and half for hours over 40. 
If hours are greater than 40, calculate the number of hours over 40.
Calculate the overtime rate by multiplying rate by 1.5.
Base pay is rate * 40
Overtime pay is overtime rate * hours over 40
Gross pay is base pay + overtime pay

If hours are 40 or less, gross pay is rate * hours

Display the gross pay in the Label.

The Exit buttonâ€™s on_release event handler will stop the application.
